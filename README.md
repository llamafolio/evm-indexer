<strong>EVM Blockchain Indexer</strong>
</h1>
<p align="center">
<strong>A scalable SQL indexer for EVM compatible blockchains</strong>
</p>

The indexer is ready and used in production. If you want to use it or contribute and need help you can [send me a DM on my personal twitter.](https://twitter.com/eaberrueta)

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) (or any other PostgreSQL db)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (used to store the indexed blocks state)

## Available Chains

This indexer is chain agnostic. It should work with any chain that follows the ETH RPC API. But some chains have some minor modifications that could result in them not being able to sync.

The following chains have been tested and indexed successfully:

- Arbitrum One.
- Arbitrum Nova.
- Avalanche.
- BitTorrent Chain.
- BNB Chain.
- Celo.
- Ethereum.
- Fantom.
- Gnosis Chain.
- Moonbeam.
- Optimism.
- Polygon.
